## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) - A utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

I started this project with the idea of trying out [Tailwind Framework](https://tailwindcss.com) and I styled this project entirely with Tailwind CSS. Its easy to customize and it's very time saving than styling with traditional css.

**Some problems I have with using [Tailwind CDN](https://cdn.tailwindcss.com) so far**

- Adding Google font to a Tailwind Project
  First, copy the HTML links generated by Google Font website after choosing the font you are going to use and paste them inside the `<head>` tags in your `html` file.
  After that, add a new configuration for the font inside the config

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    fontFamily: {
              sans: ["Hanken Grotesk", "sans-serif"],
    }
  }
}
```

- The default box-shadow is decent but it's not like the given design so I have to add new custom rule inside the config

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    boxShadow: {
      custom: "-50px 10px 13px -18px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 15px 15px 13px -18px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 15px -8px 15px -18px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);",
    }
  }
}
```

- The default biggest max-height from Tailwind is `max-h-96(24rem)` , so I have to add another new custom rules for the max-height. The difference between `max-h-96(24rem)` and `max-h-80(20rem)` is `16(4rem)` that's why I give these two their respective name.

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    maxHeight: {
              112: "28rem",
              120: "30rem",
    }
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I'm still not satisfy with those redundant classnames inside the HTML file. I'll try to improve myself in naming custom rules and writing clean code.
